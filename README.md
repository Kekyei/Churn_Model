# Churn_Model
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment.A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn.
This predictive model was built with a random forest classifier to predict customers that are likely to churn at their current price.
